# Netlify redirects for Single Page Application (SPA)
# This file tells Netlify to serve index.html for all routes
# so React Router can handle client-side routing

# Redirect all routes to index.html (except for actual files)
/*    /index.html   200

# Optional: Redirect old paths if you have any
# /old-path    /new-path    301
